    This function transforms the reported (string) datetime to a timestamp.
    A few notes:
    - THIS DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT TIMEZONE ! This is for a previous version of
      chronicle that didn't save time zone information yet.
    - Time is rounded to 10 milliseconds, to make sure the apps are in the right order.
      A potential downside of this is that when a person closes and re-opens an app
      within 10 milliseconds, it will be regarded as closed.
